# Naive-Bayes for Text Classification

The simplest solutions are usually the most powerful ones, and Naïve Bayes is a good example of that. Despite the great advances of the Machine Learning in the last years, it has proven to not only be simple but also fast, accurate, and reliable. It has been successfully used for many purposes, but it works particularly well with natural language processing (NLP) problems.

Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem, used in a wide variety of classification tasks.
